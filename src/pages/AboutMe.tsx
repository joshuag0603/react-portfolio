                <p> I am a digital designer who focuses on User Experience and User Interface with the goal of increasing accessibility for all types of users. I have primarily been using Figma to create website and app prototypes that allow users to easily understand and navigate the information in front of them. In the past I have worked on projects related to social justice, agriculture, brand marketing, collective action. I am currently interested in pursing projects related to social justice, mental health wellness, and generally increasing the accessibility of websites for all users. 

                In 2024 I graduated from Fordham University where I studied New Media and Digital Design. Over the course of my studies I took courses in UX Design for Empowering, Designing Smart Cities, Digital Cause Marketing, Game Culture: Theory and Practice, Visual Thinking, Creative Coding, Video Game Design, and Graphic Design and Digital Tools. </p>
